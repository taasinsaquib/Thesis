# May - June 2021
* Initial idea to work with the biomimetic eye model 
* Incorporate it into the final project for CS 275 - Artificial Life - Demetri Terzpoulos
	* code [here](https://github.com/taasinsaquib/fetch_urp)
* Goal was to create a dog model that could see a bone being thrown and then go find it
	* Used Unity
	* I worked on the retina model, which casts rays into the scene in a log-polar distribution
	* It takes in color from the objects hit by the rays, which is used to form the optic nerve vector, or ONV
